<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I hail from one of the most beautiful countries in the world; Fiji. I have always been interested in technology for as for as I can remember.
  As a young lad, I have had the honor of owning a PC, something that very few families were fortunate enough to have. With this PC, a new world opened up to me, with many hours of experimenting. 
  Was most fortunate to discover the amazing world of web development during this period and have never looked back.
